# Account Summary Report

The account summary report can summarize the net value of your accounts
for a specified date, including the value of your investments up to that date.
It can also normalize the report to a given currency. The currency must be
defined under [View/Currencies](../Basics/Currencies.md) and you will get 
more accurate prices on securities if you enable a [Stock Quote Service](../Accounts/StockQuoteServices.md).

Here we see a report from [sample data](../Basics/SampleData.md), normalized to
the Australian currency.
