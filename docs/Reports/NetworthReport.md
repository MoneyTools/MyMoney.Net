# Networth Report

To get a report on Net Worth select the Net Worth item under the Reports menu and you will see something like this:

![](../Images/Networth%20Report.png)

This report summarizes the current value of all your holdings up to the
given date and subtracts credit card balances, and any loans to provide a net worth total.

You can pick different dates to get a detailed report for any date that you have historical
stock quote data for, see [StockQuoteService](../Accounts/StockQuoteServices.md).

You can also create [Asset](../Accounts/Assets.md) accounts to cover the value of personal property so those show up in the report also.Â  Just set the Account Type to "Asset" in the Account properties dialog.

The bar chart shows the networth back in time.
