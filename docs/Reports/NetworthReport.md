# Networth Report

To get a report on Net Worth select the Net Worth item under the Reports menu and you will see something like this:

![](../Images/Networth%20Report.png)

This report summarizes the current value of all your holdings up to the
given date and subtracts credit card balances, and any loans to provide a net worth total.

You can pick different dates to get a detailed report for any date that you have historical
stock quote data for. Simply edit the date field.

Historical stock quotes come from your configured [StockQuoteService](../Accounts/StockQuoteServices.md).

You can also create [Asset](../Accounts/Assets.md) accounts to cover the value of personal property so those show up in the report also.Â  Just set the Account Type to "Asset" in the Account properties dialog.

The bar chart shows the networth back in time.  You can click a bar chart column to regenerate the report
for the date listed in the tooltip for that bar.
