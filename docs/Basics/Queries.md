# Adhoc Queries

The **Query**  menu in the main menu allows you to construct an advanced query to find specific group of transactions across all your accounts.

A combo drop down appears in each field as you fill this query
giving you the list of valid values you can use except for the
Value column where you get to type the data you are trying to find.

If you search for a Category, Payee or Memo it can also match a Split in which case you will
see matching splits shown as read only fake transactions.

You can use the up arrow icon in the top right of the above screenshot to hide the query panel after you are done.

You can also do simple filtering with the [Quick Search](QuickSearch.md) feature.
