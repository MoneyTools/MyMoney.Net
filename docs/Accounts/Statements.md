# Statements

It is handy to be able to link your [Balanced Accounts](BalancingAccounts.md) with the actual
statement you got from your bank so that you can jump to that statement from any balanced
transaction by selecting the `Goto Statement` context menu item.

You can provide a statement (usually a pdf file) while you are balancing an account by clicking
browse next to the Statement file field.  MyMoney will copy the statement to a special Statements
folder next to your MyMoney database file and it will build and index of these statements so that
later when you select [Goto Statement](ContextMenu.md) on a reconciled transaction it will be able to find and open
that statement.

Sometimes your bank might consolidate multiple accounts in one statement.  For example, it is common
for banks to combine the statement for your Savings account and your Checking account in one
statement.  In this situation, you should provide the same statement file in each of your accounts
during balancing.  MyMoney is smart enough to store only one copy of the file and it will be
available from the reconciled transactions from either account.
