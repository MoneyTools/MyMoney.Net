# Credit Card Accounts

Credit Card Accounts are essentially identical to [Bank Accounts](BankAccounts.md), except they will be listed in a different group in your Accounts Panel listed under "Credit":

Some financial programs reverse the sign on all credit transactions.  MyMoney does not.  So the Credit Card balance will show up as a negative number in red.

This is to help remind our kids that red is bad, credit cards are dangerous.  User beware :-)

You must remember this when [Balancing](BalancingAccounts.md) a credit card account, the "New Balance" is usually negative, rather than positive.

See [Investment Accounts](InvestmentAccounts.md) | [Context Menu](ContextMenu.md).
