MyMoney can download from **twelvedata.com** or **yahoo.com** .  These services require a registered account and will provide an API Key which you enter here.  Depending on your plan you will also have limits on the number of requests per minute or per day or per month.  Enter those numbers here and MyMoney will ensure those limits are not exceeded.  Just leave the value at 0 if there is no limit.  MyMoney recommends
using **twelvedata.com**.

During the download you will see some progress information in the status bar on the bottom right.  If the download is blocked on the quota limits this progress bar may pause for a moment.  If you reach daily or monthly limits the download will print an error message explaining why the stock quotes are not updating right now.

### Cache

The stock quote information is cached in a folder named `StockQuotes`
next to your *.mmdb money database file.  There is also a special
`DownloadLog.xml` index file in this folder which keeps tabs on how
recently the stock quotes were updated and so on.  These cached files
are used to efficiently compute the historical market value for your
[investment accounts](InvestmentAccounts.md) which you can view by selecting
different dates in the [Portfolio Report](../reports/InvestmentPortfolio.md)
and in the [Networth Report](../reports/NetworthReport.md).
