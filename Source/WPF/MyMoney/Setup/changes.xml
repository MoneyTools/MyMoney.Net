    </change>

    </change>
    <change version="1.1.0.47" date="7/9/2019">
        In the stock history graph, use the price at the time of the add, not the current price.
        Add a "loading..." prompt on reports that take a while to generate.
        Always show cached stock history even when new history is being downloaded.
    </change>
    <change version="1.1.0.45" date="7/6/2019">
        Further optimize startup performance by delaying the use of stock quote history
        until the user does a "View by security" request.  Optimize when stock quote
        history is downloaded, namely, only when there are holes in the history that need filling.
        Add a "stock" tab with chart showing stock history (when in "View by security" mode).
        Some tweaks to UI Themes.
    </change>

        Add Retirement accounts (thanks to andreva7 on github!).  You can still use account properties to 
        mark a retirement account as "Tax Deferred" (which would be the case with a 401k account).  If you
        leave this unchecked it will be assumed it is tax free (like a Roth IRA).

        Addded Online/Stock Quote Account dialog where you can enter the API key and any API limits.
        It supports using both services at once since iexcloud.io is best at
        downloading a bunch of stock quotes and alphavantage.co is best at downloading history.
        It will fill in missing UnitPrice information in Investment accounts using stock quote history.
    </change>

        currently support mutual funds.
    </change>
    <change version="1.1.0.8" date="1/22/2018">
        Fix Tax Report so that TaxExempt securities are reported in separate column, this way you
        can see two totals for dividends, first column is taxable dividends, and the second is
        taxexempt. This is handy for dividends on Municipal Bonds and other tax exempt funds.
        Also removed budgetting UI since the feature requires a complete overhaul.
    </change>
    <change version="1.1.0.7" date="1/1/2018">
        Yahoo turned off their free stock quote service, so switching to https://www.alphavantage.co.  Unfortunately this service doesn't support batch downloading, so you have to wait longer for each stock price to be updated.  The service does provide a lot more information however, so  we can do a lot more with that in the future.
    </change>
    <change version="1.1.0.6" date="1/1/2018">
        Add support for separate "OnlineAccountId" because some online accounts do weird thigns to your
        account number.  For example, Discover Card changes your card number to something like this:
        'Discovr82X02X6234X2511' and then you need to match online accounts to this string, so the
        Online Account Dialog now allows you to set this in a separate field so the online account
        downloads work properly.  When you do the first time connect to Discover it will find a new
        account that doesn't match yours, click the box to create this account then look at it's
        account id, you should see something like the above.  Copy that account id to your real account
        Online Account Id, then delete the new account.  After this online downloads should work properly again.
