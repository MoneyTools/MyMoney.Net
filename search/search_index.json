Save a lot of typing using Online Banking to download statements from your bank, using OFX over secure HTTPS. No middle man storage of your account information, MyMoney talks directory from your PC to your bank, which is just as secure as if you logged onto your Bank website and downloaded transactions yourself. For banks that don't support OFX, you can download Money or Quicken QFX files and import them. Also supports CSV importing . Secure storage of your data in a local SQL Lite database. See Setup for details. Instant Charts and Reports show everything from current spending trends in your accounts, to pie charts showing spending by category, to bar charts showing historical spending by year or month, to portfolio charts showing your current holdings across stocks, mutual funds, and other investment categories. Tax Categories can be assigned so that you can export your tax information to Turbo Tax. This includes a capital gains tax report for investments organized into short term and long term. See Tax Report . Bug free account reconciliation ( balancing ) process that guarantees that once a statement is reconciled it stays that way. MyMoney stops you from making silly mistakes that could destroy years of account balancing. Quick Search gives you a powerful ability to find anything in many years of historical data almost instantly. For example, type \"(costco or arco) and fuel\" to find all transactions recording a fuel related purchase from either costco or arco. You can also do more Advanced Queries to find a specific set of transactions. Attachments can be associated with each transaction which is handy for tracking additional information that doesn't fit in the memo field. You can also use this to store a scanned copy of your store receipts so you can find your receipts quickly and easily. You can also attached bank statement .pdf files during account balancing so you can easily open the statement for a given reconciled transaction. Every numeric field in the application pops up a calculator so you can enter expressions to compute the value you want in that field. This saves you from having to switch between applications and makes entering data much more efficient. Extensibility in the architecture so developers can easily add their own favorite features. For example, one developer added support for managing rental properties and loans while another added support for easily tracking sales tax. Multiple currencies . When you setup an account you can specify the currency used by that account. This is handy if you have overseas accounts.

The Tax Report also computes long term and short term capital gains based on those same Cost Basis calculations. For example, suppose you bought 100 shares of Microsoft stock on 1/1/2001 Then if you enter the correct stock split information you would have a 2 for 1 split recorded on 2/18/2003: This means the portfolio report will show a calculation of your Cost Basis and total Gain/Loss showing your cost basis is $15 (half the $30 you paid before the stock split). The quantity will be doubled because in today's terms the stock split in 2003 means you now own 200 shares. Now it gets more interesting if you have several purchases on different dates each with different cost basis, then you do a single sale to sell all your holdings. The sale has to record the correct cost basis in order compute the correct long or short term capital gains. For example, suppose you have this: Then the portfolio report will double the units in the first 2 transactions but not the 3rd since 2013 comes after the last stock split. So this leaves a total of 350 shares and the unit price is the weighted average, and the Cost Basis is the sum of what you paid for all the shares. The Gain/Loss is computed using today's stock price. Yeah, I wish I bought more :-) Now if you sell some shares: The capital gains tax report will report two separate events for the sale since they have different dates acquired, and therefore different cost basis. Notice the stock split also means the first lot has half the acquisition price and therefore much higher gain. It also determines if the gain is long term or short term capital gain. Transfers # Now transfers can make this even more interesting. Suppose you transferred those MSFT shares to a different account before selling them. Then the first account will show this: And the Fidelity account will show this: But the original cost basis information has to flow over to the other account with the \"transfer\". So in this case the Tax report will show the exact same thing. FIFO Rule # Now in computing the capital gains the assumption is made that when you sell some stocks you want to sell from your oldest holdings first, and sometimes this is required by law. So the FIFO rule is used in matching sales with purchases. This is why the above Capital Gains report shows the 250 shares were drawn from the first lot dated 2/8/2001 and the second lot dated 12/5/2001 and after this sale your portfolio report lists the remainder of 50 shares dated 12/5/2001 and the untouched third lot dated 1/7/2013 containing 50 shares.","title":"Cost Basis"},{"location":"Accounts/CostBasis/#cost-basis","text":"The Investment Portfolio report computes the cost basis of shares that you still own based on when those shares were added to your money accounts, taking into account any stock splits that have been recorded for those securities (see Securities ).

Here we see 8 new transactions were found and merged in my Citibank VISA account: You can click the row saying \"Downloaded 8 new transactions\" and it will change the Transaction view to show you those 8 new transactions only so you can quickly review them, fill in missing category information and double check everything looks good. For a more automated download MyMoney.Net also supports OFX banking. When you have configured your OFX information correctly the download button will do the above without having to logging into websites, finding the recent activity, exporting it then importing it into MyMoney.Net. So it is a lot simpler: If your bank is in the OFX Bank List then MyMoney may be able to download statements for you using the OFX protocol over a secure sockets (SSL) channel. If you are not sure you trust the internet for this sort of thing, please see Online Security for more information. You can sign up for online banking features using the \u201c Download Accounts \u201d menu item on the accounts panel context menu, or on the top level Online menu. This takes you to the following Online Accounts dialog. This dialog fetches known banks that support online banking (otherwise known as OFX ) and shows a list in the Name field dropdown. Find your bank in this list and then click \u201c Connect\u2026\u201d. If your bank is not listed here you may need to call and find out what the OFX Address is, and the Institution Name and ID. Sometimes you can search the web and get the information from other financial software packages. If you still have a copy of Quicken lying around it has log files that contain this information. When you connect, if anything goes wrong you will see a message like this. In this case you need to call your bank and ask for the online banking feature to be enabled. If you have other problems connecting to your bank, then check the Known OFX Issues for more information. If the \u201c Connect \u201d step works then it will show you the information returned from the OFX address, together with the credentials you need to logon: If this looks right you can enter your online banking user id and password for that bank. Included are instructions from the financial institution on how to enroll in online services in case you have not done that yet. It is possible that your bank will also challenge you to provide more information as part of their \" Multi-Factor Authentication \", or \"AUTHTOKEN\", or \"ChangePassword\" protocols. If you enter the right authentication information then you should see your online accounts which you can then Add (if they are not already found in your list of accounts). The question mark icon means the account number didn't match any of your existing accounts. Click this question mark button to find the matching account or add this account to your list of accounts. If the account was found in your local database you will see a green check mark instead: If you were expecting a green check mark, but instead see a blue question mark for a given account, then it means your account numbers don't match what was downloaded from your bank. You can go back to your Account Properties to fix your account number, then try again. Sometimes a financial institution might add or remove a dash in the account number. See Setup Accounts Multiple Accounts at the same Financial Institution # If you are tracking multiple accounts in the same Money Database that come from the same online bank (for example, you may have a personal AMEX card and one for work) then you may need two separate online accounts for that bank, with different logon credentials. To set this up, edit the \"Name\" field of the OnlineAccount dialog so it is unique: When you click Connect you will then be prompted for new credentials, type in the different credentials. Deselecting Accounts You can remove the online banking connection for a given account by clicking the checkmark icon to toggle the state to \"disconnected\" and this still stop that account from receiving future updates when you synchronize online accounts: Downloading Statements # Now when you click the download button the following tab appears at the bottom section of the app and when complete it tells you how many transactions were downloaded: You can click the row titled \"Downloaded 10 new transactions\" to see the transactions that were downloaded. From there you can add missing Category information. They will stay bold as a reminder that you need to review them. A good practice is to only accept the ones you have receipts for. For example, I recently found a transaction for several thousand dollars for the purchase of a painting in Denmark on my credit card. I had no recollection of this transaction, nor any receipt, and was able to quickly inform my credit card company and start the fraud investigation the same day the charge appeared in my downloaded transactions. The bold highlighting helps make these new 'unverified' transactions more visible. The first download will get as much data as is available from the online service. If you need more history you may be able to manually download OFX, QFX or QIF files from your bank's website and then use File/Import\u2026 to import those in the money program. You can also import OFX, QFX or QIF files from other financial software packages if you have the history there. The OFX or QFX format is preferred, QIF is harder to merge because it doesn't contain account information. Sometimes the OFX service might be down for maintenance, and you will get an error like this: When this happens you can click the \"Details\" link to find out more about what happened, sometimes this contains a message from the bank as to why the service is unavailable.

In this case if you agree it is a duplicate you can click the \"Merge\" button and the transactions will be merged. You can do the same operation using drag/drop. Note that if a row is selected and you left click it again to begin a drag drop it will not drag drop it will go into edit mode: To solve this, click on a different row, then you can drag this row. The transactions are merged in a way that tries to preserve any information that you might have entered in each transaction. For example, if you added a Category on one, and a Memo on the other, both of these edits will be preserved. If you know these are not duplicates, you can click the \"(x)\" button instead, and this will remember your selection so it won't prompt you again.","title":"Merging Duplicate Transactions"},{"location":"Basics/Navigation/","text":"Navigation # There are several ways to navigate between different views, and MyMoney keeps a history of the views you have visited .
